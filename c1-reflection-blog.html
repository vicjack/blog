    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
    <p>Its good that the phase 0 approach is a taster to see if this suits both you individually, and largely whether you believe you can fit with the requirements of a bootcamp cohort. I like the idea of smaller groups of people that are working together - many chefs in the kitchen, varied talents, learning styles and skillsets.</P>
<h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
<P>Restaurant Mindset - Package mindset<BR>
<p>Kitchen/Creator Mindset <BR>
To be honest, when I listened to the movie, I kind of see myself as a bit of bot mindsets. I am definitely in a Creator Mindset, but I guess there is also part of me that has a great expectation of what doing this and making some sacrifices, will help me to achieve. I’m kind of mixture of both the different mindsets, I am hoping that with drive and tenacity, I’ll make it through. 

<h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
  <P>I am naturally conscious, creative and collaborator. I enjoy seeing myself and others achieve great things. I working best with people who are openminded to ideas, with an eager willingness to solve problems.
<h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
   <P>Yes a little, maybe in that there is also a requirement from your end that we achieve. Also, that by committing and completing this that there are no 'guarantees'.
<h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
   <p> I'm totally excited, but a little nervous with a touch of overwhelm. Particularly as the video suggested that by the time you hit bootcamp that you shouldn’t have anything (a job or an outside commitment). I have a business, and also a single busy parent. I will manage, but I do recognise that I will need a bit more flexibility around the way that I do this.
